```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

First, install the googledrive package and log in to Google
```{r}
install.packages("googledrive")
library(googledrive)

drive_auth() #authorize Drive account and log in
```

I want to pull the data I'm using for my thesis:
```{r}
googledrive::drive_find(pattern="group spring 2019", n_max=10)
# cool!
```

Now I want to do some stuff with Google Sheets
```{r}
install.packages("googlesheets4") #install & library the googlesheets4 package
library(googlesheets4) 
```

Reading a spreadsheet:
```{r}
RME_newdata <- googlesheets4::read_sheet("1dcR4gNMG0mZJ4S6qxNsh1vGhmMo6fVmdukLGUtKJ7jg") #this is the ID of the sheet I want from chunk 3

# It worked!
```

(I'm currently working on some R code to clean the data I uploaded above)
